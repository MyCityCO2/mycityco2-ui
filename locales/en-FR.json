By increasing the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere, we disrupt the Earth's climate balance, leading to serious consequences. The primary risk is climate change, which causes dramatic environmental changes such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disruption of ecosystems. These changes have repercussions on agriculture, water availability, and human health. Reducing GHG emissions and transitioning to a sustainable economy is essential to prevent these risks and protect our planet."

Depreciation for impairment is the accounting recognition of a decrease in the value of an asset resulting from usage, time, change of technology, or any other cause. Because of the difficulties in measuring this decrease, depreciation generally consists of spreading the value of depreciable assets over a probable life span.",
