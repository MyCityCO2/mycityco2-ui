      "text": "Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions represent a set of major risks for our planet and all living beings residing on it. By increasing the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere, we disrupt the Earth's climate balance, leading to serious consequences. The primary risk is climate change, which causes dramatic environmental changes such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disruption of ecosystems. These changes have repercussions on agriculture, water availability, and human health. Reducing GHG emissions and transitioning to a sustainable economy is essential to prevent these risks and protect our planet."

Emission balance in France from 1990 to 2020. Secten report ed. 2023.), emissions were 456.4 Mt CO2e in 2016 and the objective defined by the Paris Agreement of -50% by 2030 compared to 1990 leads us to 270 Mt CO2e for 2030. By extrapolation, since 2016, communities must follow a trajectory of reduction of 3.65% each year."
