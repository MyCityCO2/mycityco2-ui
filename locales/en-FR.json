Thus, MyCityCO2 allows local authorities to focus on implementing actions to decarbonize public services. MyCityCO2 facilitates raising awareness among a wide audience (citizens, elected officials, etc.) about the challenges of climate change related to greenhouse gas emissions. Is my municipality aligned with the trajectory defined by the National Low Carbon Strategy (SNBC), France's roadmap to meet the Paris Agreement? MyCityCO2 will allow you to visualize your carbon trajectory compared to the target trajectory."
